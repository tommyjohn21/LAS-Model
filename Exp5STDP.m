% multiplication with the KernelToMultiplication method for Projection
% class; this will not allow us to use the P_I2 for now, since it is not method
% multiplication; will address this at some point, but right now, let's
% just look under the STDP hood

% STDP; we'll try that there for nowâ€”confirmed with JY
